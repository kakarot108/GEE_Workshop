// Add images through Imports.

// NB: This script doesn't run before the exercise 1 is carried out.

// Set the map center and zoom location.
Map.setCenter(102.42, 16.32, 6);

// Add two layers on display.
Map.addLayer(srtm, {min: 0, max: 3000}, 'srtm');
Map.addLayer(forest, {bands: 'treecover2000', max: 100}, 'treecover');

/* EXERCISE 1:

Use the search bar to find the two data sets needed: 

1. SRTM Digital Elevation Data 30m
2. Hansen Global Forest Change v.1.5 (2000-2017)

Inspect their metadata, and import them into the script.

Name the imports so that they match the variables in the script.

Now try running the script. 
*/


/* EXERCISE 2: 

Add a color palette for each of the layers and save it into the script. 
See https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/image_visualization for more advanced examples, e.g. color ramps. */


/* EXERCISE 3:

Export one of the image visualizations to Google drive by using the the Image.visualize() function to pre-format the image
