//EXERCISE: 

// 1) Create a feature collection contraining at least 5 polygons 
// 2) For each feature in the collection add a property called "class" and assign it a value ["trees", "ground", "water"]
// 3) Add your polygons to the map with different styling for each class
// 4) For each feature calculate the area of the feature and add it as a property
// 5) Load the Global Carbon SOil Map and clip it to your Feature collection "ee.Image("OpenLandMap/SOL/SOL_ORGANIC-CARBON_USDA-6A1C_M/v02")"
// 6) For the ground and tree polygons calculate the average Soil Carbon content for each polygon at 30cm depth
// 7) Plot the Feature with the highest organic carbon in red
// 8) Export your feature collection which includes the average carbon at 30cm to Google Drive
